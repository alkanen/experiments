# Life Simulator

A crappy virtual life simulator with blob agents shambling about a world filled
with food, wonders, shambing agents and possibly dangers.

## Agents

An agent is a worthless sack of dirty water and some DNA.  The DNA is used to
construct the water sack, specifying the parameters to which its pitiful life
will forever be constrained.  The DNA will also be the basis for a tragically
insufficient neural network to help it shamble unsteadily towards what it
mistakenly thinks is food.

## Resources

All agents need energy to fill that dark, empty void in their souls. To get
energy they have to eat things. These things may be plants, waste products or
even more useless sacks of water than themselves.  Apart from energy, the agents
will require other nutrients in order to survive.

Waste products are generally not very energy rich, and may be even be harmful.
Luckily, the sacks of waste are unlikely to be clever enough to realise this.

Other agents are likely to be rich in easily-digested energy and nutrient
goodness, but they may put up a fight.

Vegetables are often quite docile, but agents need to eat a lot of them to
satisfy their energy needs, and lots of food means lots of poo, and lots of
time spent on eating rather than doing other things.

### Vegetation

Several different kinds of plants will grow all over the world.  Different
species contain different nutrients and amounts of energy.  How mature a plant
is will also affect its content a bit.  Old plants will eventually die and leave
some waste.

Simple plants propagate through growth to neighbouring areas, and if all plants
are eaten they will not continue to propagate in the area for a long time.
Eventually the remaining root system may sprout a new juvenile plant that can
begin a new colony if left alone.
