# Future features

 * Request either a number of samples or a specific run time from a client.
 * Give clients a variance ratio value to use for per-pixel convergence optimisation.
   - The client ratio should be lower than the ratio used per section by the server
     since we don't want clients to risk running forever.  There also needs to be
     a highest number of samples or a time limit put in place.  See above.
