This is a repository where I try to fix the issues I've had with the script to
download the FFHQ face image dataset used in StyleGAN.

The original script can be found in one of the StyleGAN authors' github
repository (https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset) and that is probably
wherre you should begin, rather than using my variant since I won't guarantee
that I keep this up to date in any way.
